            About Me? hmmm where should I start? I was born and raised in New
            York City, Harlem to be exact. I grew in the 90's and 2000's, which
            was a wild time to be where I'm from. I Left in 2004 and joined the
            Military, where I traveled the world serving the country and all
            that other fun stuff. Met my wife, left the military, had my son and
            packed up and moved to California to go to school. I got my
            Bachelors in Game Art and Design down in Los Angeles, then moved to
            the Bay Area in 2014.
          </p>

          <p class="fontStyle" id="contentPara-2">
            In the last few years I did alot of freelance work while doing
            senior management at logistics companies (military background),
            until I decided to start my own company, an immersive entertainment
            studio focusing on media content designed for emerging technologies
            like virtual reality. If im not churning away at 3d art assets,
            designing interactive content or attempting to learn C#, I'm playing
            Minecraft, Brawlhalla, or Monster Hunter World with my 9 year old
            son.
